Cyberattacks,China accuses US of launching cyberattacks during Asian Winter Games - Al Jazeera,"Police in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin have accused the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of launching “advanced” cyberattacks during the Asian Winter Games in February, targeting essential industries.
However, the report contained considerable details on the cyberattacks and the suspected individuals.
The attacks had “the intention of sabotaging China’s critical information infrastructure, causing social disorder, and stealing important confidential information”, it added.
The US routinely accuses Chinese state-backed hackers of launching attacks against its critical infrastructure and government bodies.
In December, China said it found and dealt with two US cyberattacks on Chinese tech firms to “steal trade secrets” since May 2023, but did not name the agency involved.","['accuses', 'asian', 'cyberattacks', 'china', 'launching', 'winter', 'games', 'chinese', 'attacks', 'agency', 'nsa', 'accused', 'added', 'involved', 'report', 'critical', 'information', 'infrastructure', 'city', 'harbin', 'national', 'security', 'industries', 'alleged', 'university', 'state', 'xinhua', 'suspected', 'individuals', 'trade', 'important', 'heilongjiang', 'china’s', 'specific', 'cyber']",2025-04-15,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/15/china-accuses-us-of-launching-cyberattacks-during-asian-winter-games,al jazeera,www.aljazeera.com,negative,-0.7992,2025-04-17T15:43:15.029164

Cyberattacks,China acknowledges its role in years of cyberattacks against US over support of Taiwan: report - New York Post,"Chinese officials shocked their American counterparts during a secret meeting where they allegedly revealed Beijing was behind a series of cyberattacks against the US due to Washington’s support of Taiwan, according to a new report.
The extent of Beijing’s role was left ambiguous, but US officials interpreted it as a clear threat regarding America’s support of Taiwan as an independent nation, officials familiar with the meeting told the outlet.
Wang’s comments came after the US warned China that attacks against critical civilian infrastructure could be viewed as an act of war, one former US official said.
Beijing’s comment was especially shocking given that the US team wanted to give China a chance to dispel doubts that it was involved with the hacking attacks, the official added.

Cyberattacks,Poland Says Russian Cyberattacks Intensify Ahead of Vote - The Defense Post,"Poland’s ministry of digital affairs on Tuesday came out against what it said was a growing number of Russian cyberattacks, just one month ahead of the country’s presidential election.
Authorities in Poland, a staunch ally of neighbouring Ukraine, have warned in recent months that Moscow might seek to interfere with the May 18 election through cyberattacks and disinformation.
“Today we counted almost 2,000 incidents and the day is not over yet,” Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digital affairs minister, told news channel TVN24, adding that the uptick had begun at the start of the year.
“There are 60,000-70,000 attacks a month” of various sizes, he said, reiterating the view that Poland was “in cyberwar with Russia.” According to Gawkowski, Russian services are trying to trigger “emotions and panic” by targeting public structures such as water and electricity distribution systems.
